career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      My name is Maria Ana Henriques and I am a Chemical Engineer with a Post-Grad in Product Management & Business Development. 
      In the last 3 years and half I have been working as a Data Analyst for Solvay.

      After 3 years working in the same team and being exposed to the same daily activities, I
      am certain this is the right moment to step out of my comfort zone and shift my career
      towards what I believe will be the future. I am very interested in being more involved in
      the lifecycle of a product, working alongside a cross-functional team in a fast-paced
      environment where I feel my contribution is meaningful. 
      
      I am eager to learn and currently looking for oportunities on the exciting Tech world!
